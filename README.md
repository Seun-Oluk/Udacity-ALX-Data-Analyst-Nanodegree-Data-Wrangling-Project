# Udacity-ALX-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Data-Wrangling-Project
In this data wrangling project, three datasets were gathered from different sources namely:
1. A twitter archive dataset was supplied and provided as a download. The dataset which is a csv file was loaded into the notebook and saved into a dataframe called
‘twitter_archive_df‘.
2. An image prediction dataset was downloaded from a given url using the request library. The contents were written to file and then read into a dataframe called
‘image_predictions’, using the read_csv function.
3. Lastly, additional data was gathered from a tweet_json.txt file that was also supplied.
Due to Twitter API access issues, I used the txt file supplied and read the data into a dataframe called ‘tweets’, using the read_json function
